        git remote is a feature provide by git.

        this feature is use to duplicate the project in your local machine to other place,
        eg. in the github (internet). the duplicate project is called remote.

        there such a command that we have to know, there're push and fetch (pull). 
        fetch (pull) is when there's a change in the origin project and we want to sync that change with the remote.
        and the push is the opposite of push.

        we use <code>git clone {the source or url of the origin project}</code> to make remote.
